# STIG: WN11-AU-000500 – Application Event Log size must be configured to at least 32768 KB

## System / Scope

- **System:** Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64), standalone
- **Environment:** Azure-hosted virtual machine used for STIG testing
- **Role of system:** User workstation endpoint used for security testing and STIG remediation within a controlled lab environment

## Finding

- The maximum size of the Windows Application event log was not configured to meet the minimum required value.
- Insufficient log size may result in overwriting audit records before they can be reviewed.

## Security Impact

- Important audit events may be lost due to log rollover.
- Reduced visibility for incident detection, investigation, and forensic analysis.
- Non-compliance with DISA STIG logging requirements.

## Remediation Performed

- Reviewed the existing Application event log size configuration.
- Configured the policy-backed registry setting to enforce a minimum Application event log size of 32768 KB (32 MB).

## PowerShell Remediation Script

```powershell
# Create the key if it doesn't exist
New-Item -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application' -Force | Out-Null

# Set MaxSize DWORD to 0x8000 (hex) = 32768 KB
Set-ItemProperty `
  -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application' `
  -Name 'MaxSize' `
  -Value 0x8000 `
  -Type DWord
```
## Validation

- Confirmed the registry value was correctly set.
- Performed a Tenable compliance rescan using the **Microsoft_Windows_11_STIG** policy.
- Verified that **STIG WN11-AU-000500** passed successfully after remediation.
